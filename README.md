**Installation**

1. **Include the Files:** 
    * Download or clone this repository.
    * Incorporate the necessary CSS (`interactive-reveal.css`) and JavaScript (`interactive-reveal.js`) files into your project.
    
2. **Add HTML Structure:**
    * Create an element (e.g., a button or image) to trigger the animation.
    * Wrap the element within a container with the class `interactive-reveal`. 
    * Add a child element with the class `interactive-reveal__content` that holds the content to be revealed.

**Example**

```html
<div class="interactive-reveal">
  <button>Click Me</button>
  <div class="interactive-reveal__content">
    <p>Surprise Content!</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Customization**

Customize the animations by modifying the CSS within `interactive-reveal.css`. Experiment with:

* Animation types (e.g., slide, fade, zoom)
* Animation durations 
* Colors and backgrounds

**Usage**

1. **Initialize:** Once  files are included in your project, initialize the interactive reveal effect with JavaScript:

   ```javascript
    const interactiveReveals = document.querySelectorAll('.interactive-reveal');
    interactiveReveals.forEach(reveal => {
        new InteractiveReveal(reveal); 
    });
   ```

2. **Triggering Animations:** The animations can be triggered through various events:

    * **Click:** The default behavior.
    * **Hover:** Modify the JavaScript to trigger the animation on mouse hover. 
    * **Custom Events:** Use JavaScript to trigger animations based on your desired interactions.
